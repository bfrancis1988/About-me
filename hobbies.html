      <p>One of my favorite things to do when it finally warms up and the sun comes out is to play frisbee golf.
        <br/>Frisbee golf rules are pretty much what you would think. You use a fisbee and make it into the goal.
        <br/>The goal is a pole with chains haning down and a basket under the chains. You try to make it in as little attempts as possible.
        <br/>I like to be outside in the sun. Pretty much as long as it is outside I like it.
